## Distributional Semantic Models
Distributional semantic models have been in rapid transformation in the past few years. There are now several distributional models and evaluation data available. Investigation will be done by implementing semantic relatedness, analogy, conceptual categorisation and gender bias tasks in each model; Glove, FastText and BERT.
## Target 
The target of this project is to investigate
- For a variety of semantic tasks, how does the performance of popular DS models differ?
- Does the pre-trained word embedding models captures the gender biasness that prevails in the dataset on which it is actually trained?
- Does gender bias emerge in one or all of the models we are testing?
To explore these questions, we have decided to see the performance of the pretrained models on the four tasks, namely: semantic relatedness, concept categorization, analogy and gender biasness which are elaborated in the upcoming sections.
